M=tf([1],[1 4 0]) 
N=ss(M)% Enter Matrix M From SS Model 
[A,B,C,D]=tf2ss([1],[1 4 0]);% Find state space model from Transfer function 
%Check controllablity
m=ctrb(A,B)% Find Rank of m 
R1=rank(m) % As rank is 3 Sys is controllable 
% Enter desired pole locations and used acker command 
K=acker(A,B,[-2 -2])% Find Rank of k
